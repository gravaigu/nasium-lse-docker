iolib.termios - an iolib (http://common-lisp.net/project/iolib)
extension for RS-422/485/232 (aka serial) interfaces - i.e. termios (3)
api common lisp wrappers with some stream abstraction.

API:

(documentation 'itty:with-serial-stream 'function)

(documentation 'itty:stty 'function)

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:

In theory it should work on all posix platforms supported by iolib. 

Tested (rx<->tx connected echo) on sbcl 1.0.44, ccl 1.5, ecl 10.7.1,
cmucl 20b and clisp 2.49 on linux x86 (32 bit) host with recent
quicklisp distribution.

TODO:

0 Checking right `#+' and `#-' for non posix features.

1 Testing on other OS and lisp implementation. 

2 Testing units.

3 Restarts on i/o methods.

4 Streams class and methods for 9-bit mode (using parity checking bits
  for data too).
